## Geographic Distribution

### West Region (CA, OR, WA, CO, AZ) - 55 reforms
California leads with 25 reforms across major metros and smaller cities. Strong state-level ADU and SB 9/10 implementation. Oregon and Washington pioneered middle housing reforms.

### South Region (TX, NC, VA, TN, GA, FL) - 35 reforms
Texas cities adopted ADU ordinances despite state preemption concerns. Virginia's DC suburbs (Arlington, Alexandria) became national reform leaders. Florida cities focused on mixed-use development.

### Northeast Region (NY, MA, PA, NJ, CT, RI, MD) - 20 reforms
New York City's inclusionary zoning and City of Yes initiatives. Massachusetts communities implemented affordable housing overlays. Buffalo's Green Code became a model for form-based codes.

### Midwest Region (MN, IL, MI, OH, IN, WI, IA, NE, MO, KS) - 27 reforms
Minneapolis 2040 became landmark national reform. Columbus, Ohio eliminated parking minimums citywide. Multiple cities adopted ADU ordinances.

## Notable Reform Categories

### Landmark Reforms

1. **Minneapolis 2040 (2019)** - First major US city to eliminate single-family zoning citywide
2. **Alexandria Zoning for Housing (2023)** - DC suburb eliminated single-family-only zoning
3. **Portland Residential Infill Project (2020)** - Allowed duplexes in all residential zones
4. **Sacramento Parking Reform (2022)** - First major CA city to eliminate parking minimums

### State-Enabled Local Action

1. **California SB 9/10 Implementation** - 20+ cities implementing state duplex/lot split law
2. **Oregon HB 2001** - Statewide middle housing requirements, multiple city implementations
3. **Washington HB 1110** - Middle housing requirements for larger cities

### High-Impact ADU Programs

1. **San Diego** - Leading CA city in ADU production
2. **Seattle** - Allowed two ADUs per lot
3. **Portland** - Early ADU adopter with strong production

## Data Quality Notes

### High Confidence Records
- Reforms from California (strong documentation from HCD)
- Large metros with planning department websites
- Reforms covered by academic research

### Medium Confidence Records
- Smaller cities with limited online documentation
- Older reforms (2014-2017) with fewer sources
- Cities where implementation details unclear

### Needs Verification
- Some effective dates (year vs. specific date)
- Reform scope (citywide vs. district-specific)
- Current status (some reforms may have been modified)

## Research Gaps

### States with Limited Coverage
- Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico (limited major reforms)
- Hawaii, Alaska (unique housing markets)
- Deep South states (fewer documented reforms)

### Reform Types Under-represented
- Fast_Track_Permitting (often part of larger reforms)
- Density_Bonus (complex programs, hard to categorize)
- Affordability_Mandate (often combined with upzoning)

## Future Research Priorities

1. **County-level reforms** - Many reforms happen at county level (unincorporated areas)
2. **Implementation outcomes** - How many units actually built post-reform
3. **Failed reform attempts** - Cities that considered but rejected reforms
4. **Ongoing proposals** - Reforms currently under consideration
