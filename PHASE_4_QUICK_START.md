# Phase 4: Quick Start (5-Minute Checklist)

**Today's Date:** November 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Phase 3 LIVE | ✅ Phase 4 READY
**Your Task:** Choose execution model + launch agents

---

## In 5 Minutes

### 1. Choose Your Path (2 min)

**Option A: Conservative**
- Sequential, safe, 8 weeks
- Run Agent 12 → validate → run Agents 13-14
- Best for: Risk-averse, first-time

**Option B: Balanced ⭐ RECOMMENDED (2 min)**
- Parallel, smart, 4-5 weeks
- Run Agents 12-13 together → add Agent 14 after 1 week
- Best for: Balance of speed + control

**Option C: Aggressive**
- All parallel, fast, 4-5 weeks
- Run all 3 agents immediately
- Best for: High confidence, want fastest

### 2. My Recommendation (30 sec)

**Choose Option B (Balanced)**

Why:
- 4-5 weeks (same as aggressive)
- Manageable (2 agents, then +1)
- Smart (Agent 14 benefits from 12-13)
- Proven approach

### 3. What You'll Do

**When Ready:**
1. Open `AGENT_12_DID_ANALYSIS_PROMPT.md`
2. Copy all (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste in Claude Code Web Tab 1
4. Press Enter
5. Open `AGENT_13_SCENARIO_MODELING_PROMPT.md`
6. Repeat for Tab 2
7. After 1 week: Copy Agent 14, paste in Tab 3

**Done.** Agents run for 4-5 weeks.

## Current Status

### Phase 3: ✅ COMPLETE
- Landing page live at `/`
- Methodology pages live at `/about/*`
- Timeline live at `/timeline`
- Dashboard working at `/dashboard`
- Build: ✅ PASSING

### Phase 4: ✅ READY
- Agent 12 prompt: ✅ Ready to copy-paste
- Agent 13 prompt: ✅ Ready to copy-paste
- Agent 14 prompt: ✅ Ready to copy-paste
- Execution guide: ✅ Created
- File structure: ✅ Zero conflicts planned

## What Phase 4 Delivers

| Agent | What | Duration | Result |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Agent 12 | DiD causal analysis | 25-30 hrs | `/api/causal-analysis/did` + dashboard tab |
| Agent 13 | Scenario predictions | 30-40 hrs | `/scenario` page + PDF reports |
| Agent 14 | Synthetic Control + Event Study | 35-40 hrs | 2 more dashboard tabs + time path chart |

**Together:** Research-grade causal inference showing:
- "Reform X CAUSED Y% permit increase"
- "If you adopt reform, expect Z permits"
- "Effect grows from 0% year 1 → peak year 3-5"

## Files You Need

### To Launch Agents (Copy-Paste These)
- `AGENT_12_DID_ANALYSIS_PROMPT.md` ← Tab 1
- `AGENT_13_SCENARIO_MODELING_PROMPT.md` ← Tab 2
- `AGENT_14_SCM_EVENT_STUDY_PROMPT.md` ← Tab 3 (after 1 week)

### To Reference
- `PHASE_4_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` ← Detailed instructions
- `SESSION_SUMMARY_PHASE_3_AND_4_READY.md` ← Full context

---

## Daily Monitoring (5 min/day)

```bash
# Check progress
git log --oneline -5

# Verify build
npm run build

# That's it!
```

---

## Timeline

### With Balanced Approach (Recommended)
```
Day 1:     You choose Option B
Day 2:     You copy-paste Agent 12 & 13
Day 3:     Agents start building
Day 8:     Add Agent 14
Day 22:    Phase 4 COMPLETE
           Causal inference methods live
           Policymakers can make data-driven decisions
```

### With Conservative Approach
```
Day 1-14:  Agent 12 alone
Day 15:    Validate, gather feedback
Day 16-35: Agents 13-14 in parallel
Day 36:    Phase 4 COMPLETE
```

### With Aggressive Approach
```
Day 1:     You copy-paste all 3
Day 2:     All 3 start building
Day 22:    Phase 4 COMPLETE
```

---

## Decision Point

### What's Your Choice?

```
[ ] A: Conservative (sequential, safe, 8 weeks)
[ ] B: Balanced (parallel, smart, 4-5 weeks) ← RECOMMENDED
[ ] C: Aggressive (all parallel, fast, 4-5 weeks)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose** Option A, B, or C
2. **Copy-Paste** agent prompts (2-3 depending on option)
3. **Monitor** with git log daily
4. **Done** - Agents run for 4-5 weeks (or 8 if Conservative)

---

## Success Looks Like

After 4-5 weeks:
- ✅ DiD analysis dashboard panel showing treatment effects
- ✅ Scenario builder page with predictions
- ✅ Synthetic control showing individual city case studies
- ✅ Event study showing dynamic effects over time
- ✅ All integrated, no errors, fully working

---

## Bottom Line

**Phase 3:** Landing page + methodology + timeline = ✅ LIVE

**Phase 4:** 3 agents creating causal inference = ✅ READY

**Your choice:** Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive = ⏳ WAITING FOR YOU

---

## Ready?

👉 **Next Action:** Decide on Option A/B/C, then copy-paste prompts

Estimated time to Phase 4 complete: **4-5 weeks** (Balanced) or **8 weeks** (Conservative)

---

**Quick Reference:**
- Option B = 4-5 weeks, good balance ⭐
- Copy Agent 12 & 13 prompts to start
- Add Agent 14 after 1 week
- Monitor with `git log --oneline` daily
- Done!

Let's build research-grade causal inference! 🚀
