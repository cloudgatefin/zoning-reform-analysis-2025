## Key Strategic Insights Provided

### Phase 3 (Weeks 1-3): Landing Page & Trust
**Why This First:**
- Credibility gates adoption
- Landing page + methodology = "we're trustworthy"
- Timeline = "reforms are happening everywhere"
- Together: Compelling entry point for policymakers

**Effort:** ~60 hours
**Deliverable:** Public landing page + 4 methodology pages + timeline

### Phase 4 (Weeks 4-8): Advanced Analytics
**Why This Second:**
- Sets you apart from all competitors
- Causal inference = defensible policy claims
- Scenario modeling = actionable predictions
- Creates genuine competitive moat

**Effort:** ~100 hours
**Deliverable:** DiD, SCM, Event Study + Scenario modeling

### Phase 5 (Weeks 9-12): Custom Reporting
**Why This Last:**
- Requires Phase 3-4 features to be complete
- Enables policymakers to present findings
- Maximum impact when rest of platform ready

**Effort:** ~60 hours
**Deliverable:** PDF/PowerPoint report generator

## Decision Points for You

### 1. Execution Scope
- **Full (12 weeks):** All 3 phases with all features
- **MVP (6 weeks):** Phases 3 + DiD + Scenarios (skip SCM/Event Study initially)
- **Recommendation:** Full plan has best ROI, but MVP gets to market faster

### 2. Development Resources
- **1 person:** 12-15 weeks
- **2 people:** 6-8 weeks
- **Who's building?**

### 3. Causal Methods
- **All three:** Complete research toolkit
- **DiD first:** Simplest, still credible (add others later)
- **Which approach?**

### 4. Report Builder Priority
- **Full featured:** PDF/PPT, branding, scheduling
- **MVP:** Simple PDF export
- **Timing?**
