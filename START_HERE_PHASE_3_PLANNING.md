## Your Three Feature Interests

### 1. **Reform Adoption Timeline** (2.3)
**Priority:** HIGH - Build in Phase 3 (Week 2-3)
- **What it does:** Animated timeline showing reforms spreading across country
- **Why now:** Low effort (6-8 hrs), high engagement impact
- **User value:** "Reforms are happening everywhere, we can too"
- **Status:** Ready to build

### 2. **Causal Inference - Three Methods** (3.2)
**Priority:** VERY HIGH - Build in Phase 4 (Weeks 4-8)
- **What it does:**
  - Difference-in-Differences: Treatment effect with controls
  - Synthetic Control: Compare to synthetic peer city
  - Event Study: Show when reform takes effect
- **Why strategic:** Sets you apart from all other tools
- **User value:** "These reforms actually caused this housing increase"
- **Status:** Detailed implementation guide created (can do incrementally)

### 3. **Scenario Modeling** (3.3)
**Priority:** VERY HIGH - Build in Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)
- **What it does:** "If we adopt ADU reform, how many new permits?"
- **Why it matters:** Answers #1 policymaker question
- **User value:** Predict reform impact before adopting
- **Status:** Ready to build

---

## Your Landing Page Request

**Status:** Complete specification created with:
- 10 page sections (hero, features, how-it-works, testimonials, etc.)
- React/TypeScript code snippets ready to implement
- Design guidelines (colors, typography, spacing)
- Competitive positioning elements:
  - Place-level granularity (24,535 vs state-only)
  - Causal inference methods (DiD, SCM, Event Study)
  - Forward-looking analysis (forecasts + scenarios)
  - Policymaker-focused (actionable insights)

**Read:** LANDING_PAGE_SPECIFICATION.md for complete details

## Recommended 12-Week Plan

### **Weeks 1-3: Phase 3 (Landing Page & Trust)**
**What to build:**
1. Landing page (20-30 hrs)
2. Methodology transparency pages (10-15 hrs)
3. Reform adoption timeline (6-8 hrs)

**Why this first:**
- Landing page establishes credibility
- Methodology pages enable trust
- Timeline shows social proof
- Together = compelling entry point

### **Weeks 4-8: Phase 4 (Advanced Analytics)**
**What to build:**
1. Difference-in-Differences causal inference (20-25 hrs)
2. Synthetic Control Method (20-25 hrs)
3. Event Study design (15-20 hrs)
4. Scenario modeling (30-40 hrs)

**Why this order:**
- DiD is foundation (most intuitive)
- Other methods build on same patterns
- Scenarios use all previous work
- Creates defensible policy claims

### **Weeks 9-12: Phase 5 (Reporting)**
**What to build:**
1. Custom report builder (40-60 hrs)

**Why last:**
- Requires Phase 3-4 features to be complete
- Enables policymakers to present findings
- Maximum impact when rest of platform ready

## Effort & Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Effort | Cost |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|------|
| 3 | Landing + Trust | Weeks 1-3 | ~60 hrs | $0 |
| 4 | Analytics | Weeks 4-8 | ~80-100 hrs | $0 |
| 5 | Reporting | Weeks 9-12 | ~40-60 hrs | $0 |
| **Total** | **Full Platform** | **12 weeks** | **~200 hrs** | **$0** |

**With 1 developer:** 12-15 weeks
**With 2 developers:** 6-8 weeks

---

## What Success Looks Like

### Week 3
- Landing page live
- Methodology fully documented
- Timeline showing reform adoption
- Early policymakers using tool

### Week 8
- Causal analysis working
- Scenario modeling live
- Policymakers presenting analyses
- Media mentions

### Week 12
- Complete policymaker platform
- Custom reports being generated
- Sustained traffic/adoption
- Ready for growth phase

---

## Your Competitive Advantage

After Phase 3-5, you'll have the **only tool** in the market with:

✅ Place-level granularity (24,535+ places vs. state-only)
✅ Research-grade causal inference (DiD, SCM, Event Study)
✅ Scenario modeling (predict reform impact)
✅ Custom reports for policymakers
✅ Complete methodology transparency
✅ Zero infrastructure cost

**Result:** Definitive tool for U.S. zoning policy

## Decision Points for You

### 1. Execution Path
**Full (12 weeks):** All features
**MVP (6 weeks):** Landing page + DiD + Scenarios (skip SCM/Event Study initially)

→ **Recommendation:** Start with full plan, can truncate if needed

### 2. Development Resources
**1 developer:** 12-15 weeks
**2 developers:** 6-8 weeks

→ **Who's building?**

### 3. Causal Methods
**All three:** DiD + SCM + Event Study (complete toolkit)
**DiD first:** Simpler, still credible (add others later)

→ **Which approach?**

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: What should I build first?**
A: Landing page (credibility) + methodology transparency (trust) + timeline (social proof)

**Q: How long will Phase 3-5 take?**
A: 12 weeks with 1 developer, 6-8 weeks with 2 developers

**Q: What's the cost?**
A: $0 (fully bootstrapped, no new infrastructure)

**Q: Will this set me apart from competitors?**
A: Yes - no other tool has place-level + causal inference + scenario modeling for policymakers

**Q: Can I do just the MVP?**
A: Yes - landing page + DiD causal inference + scenarios in 6 weeks
